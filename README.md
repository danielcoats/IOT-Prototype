# Home Automation Prototype

This repo contains a browser-based prototype designed and developed for a class assignment in Human Computer Interaction at the University of Auckland (Semester One, 2016). The high-level brief was to design a user interface enabling end-users to manage a suite of IoT devices, in order to meet their home automation needs, including enhanced energy efficiency and home security.

`DesignDocument.pdf` contains a persona and scenario that I developed based on the assignment brief, as well as low-fidelity wireframes that walk through each step of the scenario. (Only the pathway relevant to the scenario has been implemented in the prototype.) The document also justifies the choice of colour scheme and layout.
