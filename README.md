# Home Automation Prototype

This repo contains a static browser-based prototype designed and developed for a class assignment in Human-Computer Interaction (University of Auckland, Semester One, 2016).

`DesignDocument.pdf` contains a persona and scenario that I developed based on the assignment brief, as well as low-fidelity wireframes that walk through each step of the scenario.
